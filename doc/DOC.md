#### Details

Connect-A-Lab will be a setup of multiple cubes. There will be a main module,
containing a Raspberry Pi. The Pi will have pH and Conductivity sensors
attached.  
The main module will determine its configuration based on voltages:  

	* 0 V = Standalone configuration
	* 2 V = Atomic Absorbtion Spectrometer
	* 5 V = Gas Chromatagraph Mass-Spectrometer

We will be building a prototype for the Atomic Absorbtion Spectrometer.
